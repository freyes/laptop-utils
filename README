My collection of tools to make my life easier.

Motivation
==========

Since the appearance of Gnome 3 some things are broke for my setup 
(Awesome WM + carefully picked components), so I'm trying to fill the gaps with
simple scripts that ideally will do the same for me (and eventually for 
somebody else too :P)

Tools
=====

* touchpad: turn on, off, and toggle the status of the touchpad using synclient.
